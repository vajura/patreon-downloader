In config.json:
- fill out `campaignId` which is the userID as far as i can tell
- change the `subFolder` name if you want
- fill in the `monthStart` and `monthEnd` values, those are both inclusive
- and lastly copy your `cookie` from a live patreon session request
- other values change if you know what you are doing


Downloads will go into the location of the executable under:
`patreon/{subFolder}/{postName}/{imageName}.jpg`
